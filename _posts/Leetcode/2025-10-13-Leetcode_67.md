## Problem description

[Leetcode 67](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/description/)
 
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.


**Example 1:** 
- Input: a = "11", b = "1"
- Output: "100"

**Example 2:**
- Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
- Output: "10101"
 
 **Constraints:**

`1 <= a.length`, `b.length <= 104`
`a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Process
Binary addition works just like decimal addition: when the sum of two bits exceeds 1, we carry over to the next position.
We can iterate from the end of both strings (the least significant bits) while maintaining a carry variable.

For each step:

- **Sum the current bits:** Add a[i], b[i] (if available), and the carry.

- **Update result and carry:**

    - Current bit = (a_i + b_i + carry) % 2

    - New carry = (a_i + b_i + carry) // 2

Here, % 2 extracts the remainder (the bit value), while // 2 determines whether we have a carry for the next position.

**Example reasoning:**

- When the sum equals 2 → bit = 0, carry = 1

- When the sum equals 1 → bit = 1, carry = 0

- When the sum equals 0 → bit = 0, carry = 0

After processing all digits, reverse the result list to get the final binary string.

### Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: str
        :type b: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        idxA = len(a) - 1
        idxB = len(b) - 1
        res = []
        carry = 0

        while idxA >= 0 or idxB >= 0 or carry == 1:
            if idxA >= 0:
                carry += int(a[idxA])
                idxA -= 1
            if idxB >= 0:
                carry += int(b[idxB])
                idxB -= 1
            res.append(str(carry%2))
            carry = carry // 2
        return "".join(res[::-1])
```
