## Problem description

[Leetcode 206](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/description/)

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

Example 1:

- Input: s = "3+2*2"
- Output: 7

Example 2:
- Input: s = " 3/2 "
- Output: 1

Example 3:
- Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
- Output: 5

## Problem Solving Process
- Use a variable `num` to accumulate digits

- Use a variable `sign` to remember the last operator

For each character:

- If digit â†’ build the number

- If operator or end of string:

    - Based on `sign`, apply the operation to the current num and update the stack

    - Reset `num` to 0

    - Update `sign` to the current operator
- The sum of all values in the stack gives the final resultThe sum of all values in the stack gives the final result


## Code accomplish
```python
class Solution(object):
    def calculate(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = []
        sign = "+"
        num = 0
        s = s.replace(" ","") + "+"

        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(c)
            else:
                if sign == "+":
                    stack.append(num)
                elif sign == "-":
                    stack.append(-num)
                elif sign == "*":
                    stack.append(stack.pop() * num)
                elif sign == "/":
                    last = stack.pop()
                    stack.append(int(last / float(num)))
                num = 0
                sign = c
        return sum(stack)
```
