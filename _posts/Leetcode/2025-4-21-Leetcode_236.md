## Problem description

[Leetcode 236](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description)
 
 Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest `node` in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Example 1:** 
- Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**
- Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**
- Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
- Output: 1

 **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
- All Node.val are unique.
- `p` != `q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Process

Let `lca_node` be the lowest common ancestor of nodes `p` and `q`. Then `lca_node` must satisfy one of the following:

1. `p` and `q` are in the left and right subtrees of `lca_node`, respectively.
2. `p == lca_node`, and `q` is in either the left or right subtree of `lca_node`.
3. `q == lca_node`, and `p` is in either the left or right subtree of `lca_node`.

To find `lca_node` recursively, the following conditions should be met:

- If both `p` and `q` are not null, return their common ancestor.
- If only one of `p` or `q` exists, return the one that exists.
- If neither `p` nor `q` exists, return `None`.

### Detailed Algorithm

1. **If the current node `node` equals `p` or `q`**, then `node` is the lowest common ancestor of `p` and `q`.  
   → **Return `node`.**

2. **If the current node `node` is not null**, recursively search both left and right subtrees:
   - If both left and right subtree results are not null, it means `p` and `q` are on different sides, and the current `node` is their LCA.  
     → **Return `node`.**
   - If the left subtree is null, return the result from the right subtree.
   - If the right subtree is null, return the result from the left subtree.
   - If both are null, return `None`.

3. **If the current node `node` is `None`**, then neither `p` nor `q` are in this subtree.  
   → **Return `None`.**

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root

        if root:
            node_left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
            node_right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
            if node_left and node_right:
                return root
            elif not node_left:
                return node_right
            else:
                return node_left
        return None
```

## Time complexity and space complexity
- Time complexity：$$O(n)$$，where $$n$$ is number of node of tree。
- Space complexity：$$O(n)$$。
