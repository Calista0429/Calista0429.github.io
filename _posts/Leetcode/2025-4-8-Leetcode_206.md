## Problem description

[Leetcode 74](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

 {% include custom-image.html src="assets/img/2025-4-8-Leetcode-206/Problem-description.jpg" width="400" %}


Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the *reversed list*.

Example:
- Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
- Output: [5,4,3,2,1]



**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

## Problem Solving Process

We first set the additional `node = None`, which will be used to update every node.

`Temp` is used to get the next node.

For every node we get in while loop, we let it to reverse connect to the last node.

*In the first while loop*:

head point to the node 1. 

temp = head.next = 2 &nbsp; head.next = 1 -> = node = 1 -> None

node = head = 1 &nbsp; head = temp = 2

*In the second while loop*:

temp = head.next = 2.next = 3 &nbsp; head.next = 2-> = node = 2 -> (1 -> None)node

node = head = 2 &nbsp; head = temp = 3

...

The idea is connect the present node to `node`.



## Code accomplish


```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        node = None
        while head:
            temp = head.next
            head.next = node
            node = head
            head = temp
        return node
```

### Time complexity analysis
Because we need to connect every node, so the time complexity is:

```math
O(n) (n is the length of List)
```

### Space complexity analysis
In this question, we haven't used extra data structure, so the space complexity will be:

```math
O(1)
```
