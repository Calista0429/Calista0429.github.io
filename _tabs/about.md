## 👋 Hi there!

## 🎓 Background

I am a *Master’s student* at [MIZUNO Lab](https://webpark2264.sakura.ne.jp/mizu), [The University of Tokyo (UTokyo)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html).

During my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong interest in **computer vision**, **data-driven methods**, and how **machine learning** can solve real-world problems.

I also enjoy exploring the theoretical foundations of **large language models (LLMs)** and how they can be applied to domain-specific tasks.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My current research lies at the intersection of **deep learning** and **multimodal image processing**.

I’m always open to collaborations or discussions around AI applications in vertical domains.

- 🎮 **Gaming**  
- 🍳 **Cooking** 
- 🏀 **Basketball**
